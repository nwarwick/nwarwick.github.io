                <h2>What is it?</h2>
                <p>Calcohol is an application that lets users search for liquor and view a scaled alcohol per dollar (APD) score,
                    allowing them to be as economic as possible when it comes to drinking. Very helpful for college students!
                </p>
                <p>The data was previously pulled from a government API, but I moved it into my own database and wrote my own
                    API in order to make it more efficient and improve the search functionality.</p>
                <h2>What was used to make it?</h2>
                <p>Vue.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB</p>
                <h2>Where is it?</h2>
